## Statistical Analysis 

Since we have an unordered factor as an outcome variable with more than 2 levels, I ran a Bayesian multinomial logistic regression using the `brms` package in R [@burkner2017brms]
The outcome of this model was the probability of choosing "both", "is" or "is not".
The sole fixed effect predictor included was "kind" (6 levels: natural kind, abstract concept, artifact, control precise definition,  control subjective adjective and control check).
The model also included random intercepts for participant and what is labeled "spec" in the data. 

The models both included the default brms priors - Studentâ€™s T distribution with 3 degrees of freedom. The model was run using with 4000 iterations of Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo sampling (1000 warm up), across 4 chains and 8 processing cores.

## Results

@fig-hist shows that number of responses in each of the conditions abstract concept, artifact and natural kind. 
For abstract concept and artifact, "both" was the chosen the most.
For natural kind, "is not" was the most popular choice.

I've included two options here for reporting the model output. 
Really, these models do not directly give us very intuitive or interpretable information regarding whether or not we have any meaningful differences between groups, but they're good to report for the sake of being transparent and thorough. 
The first is a convenience function using `sjPlot` [@ludecke2015package].
This function produces an html table that reports odds ratios for logistic models.
The second option is using the `print` function in base R. 
This reports the results in log odds, and provides a lot of extra information.

### Print function output

## Probabilty 

For logistic models, it is usually best to convert the output of the model from log-odds to probability. 
Using an R script, I extracted the fixed effects of the multinomial model and converted them to probability.
@fig-threepost shows the probability of choosing each of the three answer choice ("is", "is not", or "both") for natural kinds, artifacts and abstract concepts.
For natural kinds, "both" and "is not" were the most probable responses, while for artifact abstract concept "both" was the most probable response.

#| label: fig-threepost
#| fig.cap: The posterior distributions of the multinomial model converted to probability

```

We had also discussed the issue of the overlapping posteriors in terms of drawing conclusions, since this would potentially be non-significant in a frequentist framework. 
@fig-effsize shows a distribution of plausible differences in probability between a given answer choice relative to another. 
On the y-axis, each pair of answer choices is the effect of going from the first to the second one. 
For example, "is not - is" shows the change in probability when going from "is not" to "is" in each of the three conditions. 
The number inside the density plot is the quantity of draws that were positive, and is essentially the probability of direction of the effect.
Knowing the probability of direction gives some more fine-grained information than (null hypothesis) significance testing, since we don't have an all or nothing approach to whether the difference is meaningful.
